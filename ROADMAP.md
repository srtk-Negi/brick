## üéØ Key Milestones

1. **Week 2**: Basic auth and tenant system working
2. **Week 4**: RBAC and team management complete
3. **Week 6**: Stripe billing fully integrated
4. **Week 8**: Production-ready with security measures
5. **Week 10**: Documented, tested, and deployable boilerplate

## üîç Critical Decisions to Make Early

- **Tenant isolation strategy**: Separate schemas vs shared tables with tenant_id
- **Permission granularity**: How fine-grained should role permissions be?
- **Billing model**: Pure subscription vs hybrid usage-based pricing
- **Deployment target**: Vercel vs self-hosted vs multi-cloud
- **Database setup**: Single DB vs tenant-per-database

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific phase or help you make some of these architectural decisions?
